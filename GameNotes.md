# Imperial Defense and Automation I.D.A. Concept
- Themes: Real Time Strategy, Tower Defense, Resource Automation.
- (See Starcraft 2, Factorio/Satisfactory )

## Game Summary:
Implemention of above listed themes:
- From Starcraft:
    - Architecting your base, Dispatching drones to build desired buildings from central nodes that store acquired materials.
- From Factorio/Satisfactory:
    - Automated resource gathering, transformation, and storage of materials to enable drones to build base designs.
- From Tower Defense:
    - Defense objectives that you must protect. Enemies will have scripted paths to objectives your job is to build a labryinth/maze of walls and defense structures to repel the enemies.

## Gaming Goal:
The ultimate goal is to build a gaming experience where your defensive structures/base will be planned ahead of time, then automation is built to enable drones that will ultimately build the base structures according to the architected design, without additional input from the user. The user will review the effectiveness of their base and redesign/rebuild as needed.

### Example Scenario:
- Game notifies user that a resource node/location (objective) is in danger of being attacked. User will be aware of the path the enemy will use to "attack" the objective. User will then survey the area to determine what resources are available. User will then determine where to start their base (where to place the Command Center/Nexus/Hatchery). Next step is to start architecting the resource acquisition.
- Once the CC begins receiving resources, the defense building starts. Defense begins by putting in measures to delay the enemies ability to advance/march on the objective (Zombies?) (queue inspiration from pitched battle movies, LOTR, Troy, Gladiator, 300). Measures to delay the enemy advance includes defense structures like pits, motes, walls, etc. As the user architects the defense structures, drones will then dispatch from the CC to start converting resources into the desired structures. As the enemy overcomes defense, more effective measures of containment required, (automated weapons and towers, etc).
- Maybe implement other drones/conveyers to direct materials to defensive structures to enable upgrading. Start an upgrade, then X amount of resources need to be ferried to the defense structure to complete the upgrade.
- Added complexity, some materials will need to be combined before being available for use in the CC, user can automate this process or access the CC and do it manually similar to Satisfactory.

# Story:
    In the future Humanity has obtained the ability to colonize the stars. But with that freedom has spawned additional challenges, namely how to ensure the safety of new colonies without the need for expending costly human lives. To solve this problem the (TBD) has come up with a revolution strategy involving the automation of defenses prior to human colonization. Your job is Architecting automated defensive solutions that can be deployed in contested locations anywhere in the known Universe. Your goal is to build a solution that can be deployed to a contested area, with your design (Robotics Company) can use the nearby resources to supply their self-propagating robotics force to build a safe, habitable structure in preparation for human colonization.
    
    You will be dispatched to a foreign world to begin the process of building the schematics needed by (Robotics Company) to make this vision a reality. As this is an experimental venture you will not be provided with resources to "get started" you will need to be self sufficient, as any sort of resource seeding will defeat the intended purpose of the venture.
